# Dot...the-app
================
Hippo's solution to help you to/not to get pregnant. Since we were having some issues earlier creating forks/repos I tried to read the "help" section (again).

    Here's what Siri tried to add earier:
    -red dot logo
    -taking temperature via bluetooth in the ear
    -notifying you a lot, or not as much, during ovulation period
    -remind you when to take out and put in nuvaring/take birth control
    -app asks you what you're feeling, ie, bloated, high sex drive
